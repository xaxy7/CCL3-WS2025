        <h2>Project description</h2>
        <p>Have you ever felt ashamed that you cannot recognize a flag? You wish that you knew more about various nations around the world?
        Our app is exactly what you need. We allow users to quickly learn every country flag by playing a dynamic quiz game with different modes.
        <h2>Team members:</h2>
        <p>Ksawery Kochanowicz & Denis Dubovicky</p>
        <h2>App concept:</h2>
        <h3>Use case</h3>
        <p>The app can be used simply for learning different facts about countries all around the world. However, it can have other benefits,
        such as creating good habits by practicing memorisation every day. It can also serve as a fun distraction to use while bored, and one that actually teaches you some
            potentially useful facts, instead of brain rotting</p>
        <h3>Target user</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Age: Teen/Young Adults, but also Seniors</li>

            <h3>Final Reflection</h3>
            <div>
                <h4>Ksawery Kochanowicz</h4>
                <p>Best part of the CCL3 for me was the app idea, since it was sort of a passion project. We developed an app we actually would like to use, which made the development process more fun. Our app was build on the foundation of my Mobile Coding project, but in the end we mostly rewrote old logic.
                    We divided the work equally, working together on many features. I personally have worked on every part of the project, mainly focusing on the quiz, summary, region and difficulty selection.  Since both of us shared passion of Geography, I found the collaboration very efficient.
                    The user testing also went smoothly, the formative test revealed some minor issues in our App design, that we later fixed to improve our final version. I had fun testing the participants, since I mostly choose people that I barely knew before.

                    Thanks to this CCL I've got more familiar with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Android as a platform. I'm very happy with the end result, since I enjoy using the app, and I find it helpful for flag and country shapes learning.

                <h4>Denis Dubovicky</h4>
                <p>During CCL3 I have properly understood how navigation works in Kotlin, as well as the overall ideal structure of an Android app.Navigation gave us a hard time, as we at first weren't sure about the scope of our project, and had troble with bugs. I have worked on every layer of our app (database, Ui, themes) like the nav bar, history screen, shape guessing mode etc.. We hav implemented everything we initially planned, even adding more features like history screen with summaries and saving round progress so user can leave and continue without starting a whole new round. Overall I am happy with the end result.</p>

                    <h3>Usability Testing Results – GeoQuest</h3>
                    <p>We ran our test twice. Our formative test was conducted with initial version of the application with 5 participants. Feedback and results obtained were used to improve design, functionality and experience of GeoQuest. Improved version was tested in the summative test. The newly recruited 5 participants pefromed the same tasks as the first testing group. Results from both experiments were compared and analyzed. 
Conclusion
We can observe slight increase of 4% in average SEQ between test A (dSEQ = 6,44) and test B (dSEQ = 6,72). Consitent with 3% increase in average SUS score and lower SUS score standart deviation.
Summative test – additional information
Four out five participants fall into the age group 18-24 and once participant in age group 35-50. 
Participants were familiar with the flags slightly above average. The average familiarity score = 3.17/5 
All of the participants answered correctly when asked to identify three flags.
4 out of 5 participants were familiar with geography apps like Geoguesser or Geotastic.
Most of the users in our participants used android as their primary smartphone operating system
All tasks were perceived as very easy or easy.
Calculated SUS score show that our paticipants rate our app with grade A and A+</p>

                <p>During the formative test we received valuable feedback from the participants, which we incorporated into our application, before the summative test.
                    We improved the navigation by adding a home and back button to several pages, we corrected the visibility of the bookmark/add to learning notebook button and generally improved the consistency of our design </p>

                <h4>Summative test:</h4>
                <p>We can observe slight increase of 4% in average SEQ between test A (dSEQ = 6,44) and test B (dSEQ = 6,72). Consistent with increase in average SUS score
