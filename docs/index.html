        <h1>GeoQuest</h1>
        <h2>Project description</h2>
        <p>Have you ever felt ashamed that you cannot recognize a flag? You wish that you knew more about various nations around the world?
        Our app is exactly what you need. We allow users to quickly learn every country flag by playing a dynamic quiz game with different modes.

        <h2>App concept:</h2>
        <h3>Use case</h3>
        <p>The app can be used simply for learning different facts about countries all around the world. However, it can have other benefits,
        such as creating good habits by practicing memorisation every day. It can also serve as a fun distraction to use while bored, and one that actually teaches you some
            potentially useful facts, instead of brainrotting</p>
